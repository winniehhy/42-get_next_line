## Get Next Line 
About the project : The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor. 

## Manatory
Understanding how files are accessed, read, and closed within an operating system, as well as how they are interpreted by a programming language for analysis, is essential for aspiring programmers. This knowledge is critical because much of programming involves manipulating files for data management and persistence. The project involves developing a function that retrieves one line at a time from a text file.


## Bonus 
enable the read function to write multiple file descriptor at the same time.
